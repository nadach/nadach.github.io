## Bio

I am a **researcher (HDR)** at [Inria](https://inria.fr/fr), and a member of the [TRiBE](https://team.inria.fr/tribe/) team at Inria Saclay.

I was an **Associate Professor (HDR)** at [Université Sorbonne Paris Nord](https://www.univ-spn.fr/) from 2004 to 2024, where I was fully dedicated to the Engineering School and contributed to training in telecommunications and networks, including responsibilities within the SupGalilée engineering school. Since September 2024, I have joined Inria as a full-time researcher.

My recent research work focuses on two complementary directions: **(i) collecting and analyzing mobility data**, especially through measurements enabled by wireless networks **(ii) resource allocation and computation offloading at the edge**, to support ultra-responsive applications with strong latency and compute constraints. **(iii) Edge AI**, where I study how to bring modern ML to constrained IoT systems by leveraging split computing/split inference and dynamic offloading to nearby edge or cloud resources.
