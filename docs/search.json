    "text": "In this postdoc, we will study the problem of AI model placement in an IDN. This is a challenging optimization problem that involves a non-trivial tradeoff between model effectiveness, inference latency, and resource availability while also dealing with the natural dynamicity of the network, e.g., due to users’ request process or changes in available computing and communication resources.\nWe will also consider other metrics, such as energy consumption, in the objective functions and networking constraints for systems where the network presents some inelasticity (see also [1]). We will leverage multi-objective optimization techniques (e.g., Pareto efficient solutions) and transfer learning techniques to adapt models across nodes with different levels of knowledge and resource availability. We will also rely on online learning approaches to achieve model placements with adversarial guarantees regarding regret.\nIn comparison to our preliminary work in [2] or [3], we will allow models to be split across multiple nodes [4,5,6]. In particular, we aim to compare specific model splitting techniques, with or without the insertion of bottlenecks [7,8] (reference [8] is also the result of NEO-AIRL cooperation), in terms of performance metrics like inference delay and network load. We will evaluate different methodologies to estimate online the quality of an inference [9].\nThis evaluation may also consider scenarios with significant heterogeneity of the nodes, such as in the scenario of embedded Edge AI or even more with TinyML (resources possibly lower by orders of magnitude but possibly a massive number of devices)."

It enables a seamless continuum from edge devices to data centers using advanced orchestration, network slicing, and non-terrestrial integration. This framework supports diverse high-performance applications like Industry 4.0, smart mobility, and digital twins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFITNESS – From IoT breakthroughs to Network Enhanced ServiceS\n\n\n\n2023-07-01 -- 2029-06-30\n\n\n\nThe FITNESS project develops innovative IoT solutions by optimizing elementary building blocks for massive connectivity, Industry 4.0, and connected transport. It focuses on critical technical constraints such as ultra-low power consumption, high security, and low latency for mission-critical vehicular applications. By ensuring the coexistence of 5G and post-5G protocols, it enables a robust and scalable ecosystem for future digital services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMob Sci-Dat Factory\n\n\nThe Mob Sci-Dat Factory builds a shared digital infrastructure to process and analyze heterogeneous mobility data for people and goods. It provides a secure cloud platform with open-source tools to support sustainable decision-making and data sovereignty in French research. This factory aims to unify scientific communities to accelerate the transition toward greener, multimodal transport systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMITIK – Mobility and contact traces from non-intrusive passive measurements\n\n\nThe MITIK project utilizes passive wireless sensors to capture spatiotemporal activity and contact traces from mobile devices without intruding on user privacy. It develops advanced methods for context-aware deployment, data anonymization, and the reconstruction of individual trajectories to model human mobility. This research enables a better understanding of social interactions and spatial usage through scientifically rigorous data collection.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"
